# cfaCampus-Safety
A project for Code for Atlanta: Campus Safety

![picture](brainstorm.jpg)

##My Milestones to reach
* Get a sample Leaflet map to work
* Understand how Leaflet markers work, replace them with a library of safety icons (phones, waterbooths for marathons, etc.)
* Create frontend that allows for people to enter GPS coordinates and make markers based on CRUD functionalities
* If there's lots of time left, make a login at the request of Code for Atlanta (but really, a service like this shouldn't need a login IMHO).
